# ARK Server Configuration Tool
A tool made for configuring and reading data from ARK servers.

## **This project is heavily work in progress, and is far from finished. It has yet to been cleaned up, so expect messy code!**

This program can be used to read and write information for your server, as well as control them!

In the finished product, you will be able to do the following:
- Get wild dinos and their status
- Configure your servers
- Shrink server size
- Update servers
