# ARK Server Configuration Tool
A tool made for configuring and reading data from ARK servers.

## **Please keep in mind that this project is heavily work in progress, and is far from finished.**

This program can be used to read and write information for your server, as well as control them!

In the finished product, you will be able to do the following:
- Get full stats for wild and tamed dinos
- Shrink server disk space
- Update servers

As of now, you can:
- Create server profiles
- Generate .ini files for server configs (more config options to be added)
- Get server run status
- Get dinos from the server map with some basic information
- Get server disk space
